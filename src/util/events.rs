//! Events are returned from various bits in the library which indicate some action must be taken
//! by the client.
//!
//! Because we don't have a built-in runtime, its up to the client to call events at a time in the
//! future, as well as generate and broadcast funding transactions handle payment preimages and a
//! few other things.
//!
//! Note that many events are handled for you by PeerHandler, so in the common design of having a
//! PeerManager which marshalls messages to ChannelManager and Router you only need to call
//! process_events on the PeerHandler and then get_and_clear_pending_events and handle the events
//! that bubble up to the surface. If, however, you do not have a PeerHandler managing a
//! ChannelManager you need to handle all of the events which may be generated.
//TODO: We need better separation of event types ^
