	/// Indicates that a channel featuring anchor outputs is to be closed by broadcasting the local
	/// commitment transaction. Since commitment transactions have a static feerate pre-agreed upon,
	/// they may need additional fees to be attached through a child transaction using the popular
	/// [Child-Pays-For-Parent](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp) fee bumping technique. This
	/// child transaction must include the anchor input described within `anchor_descriptor` along
	/// with additional inputs to meet the target feerate. Failure to meet the target feerate
	/// decreases the confirmation odds of the transaction package (which includes the commitment
	/// and child anchor transactions), possibly resulting in a loss of funds. Once the transaction
	/// is constructed, it must be fully signed for and broadcast by the consumer of the event
	/// along with the `commitment_tx` enclosed. Note that the `commitment_tx` must always be
	/// broadcast first, as the child anchor transaction depends on it. It is also possible that the
	/// feerate of the commitment transaction is already sufficient, in which case the child anchor
	/// transaction is not needed and only the commitment transaction should be broadcast.
	///
	/// In zero-fee commitment channels, the commitment transaction and the anchor transaction
	/// form a 1-parent-1-child package that conforms to BIP 431 (known as TRUC transactions).
	/// The anchor transaction must be version 3, and its size must be no more than 1000 vB.
	/// The anchor transaction is usually needed to bump the fee of the commitment transaction
	/// as the commitment transaction is not explicitly assigned any fees. In those cases the
	/// anchor transaction must be broadcast together with the commitment transaction as a
	/// `child-with-parents` package (usually using the Bitcoin Core `submitpackage` RPC).
	///
	/// The consumer should be able to sign for any of the additional inputs included within the
	/// child anchor transaction. To sign its keyed-anchor input, an [`EcdsaChannelSigner`] should
	/// be re-derived through [`SignerProvider::derive_channel_signer`]. The anchor input signature
	/// can be computed with [`EcdsaChannelSigner::sign_holder_keyed_anchor_input`], which can then
	/// be provided to [`build_keyed_anchor_input_witness`] along with the `funding_pubkey` to
	/// obtain the full witness required to spend. Note that no signature or witness data is
	/// required to spend the keyless anchor used in zero-fee commitment channels.
	///
	/// It is possible to receive more than one instance of this event if a valid child anchor
	/// transaction is never broadcast or is but not with a sufficient fee to be mined. Care should
	/// be taken by the consumer of the event to ensure any future iterations of the child anchor
	/// transaction adhere to the [Replace-By-Fee
	/// rules](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/policy/mempool-replacements.md)
	/// for fee bumps to be accepted into the mempool, and eventually the chain. As the frequency of
	/// these events is not user-controlled, users may ignore/drop the event if they are no longer
	/// able to commit external confirmed funds to the child anchor transaction.
	///
	/// The set of `pending_htlcs` on the commitment transaction to be broadcast can be inspected to
	/// determine whether a significant portion of the channel's funds are allocated to HTLCs,

	/// transaction's confirmation. Note that this is not required, but simply exists as an option

	///    e.g., Bitcoin Core's `fundrawtransaction` RPC requires at least one output to be
	///    provided, in which case a zero-value empty OP_RETURN output can be used instead.
	/// 3. Enough inputs must be selected/contributed for the resulting transaction (including the
	///    inputs and outputs noted above) to meet `target_feerate_sat_per_1000_weight`.
	/// 4. The final transaction must have a weight smaller than `max_tx_weight`; if this
