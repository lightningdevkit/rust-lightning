/// A trait indicating an object may generate events.

/// Implementations of this trait may also feature an async version of event handling, as shown with

/// [`ChainMonitor::process_pending_events_async`].
///
/// # Requirements
///
/// When using this trait, [`process_pending_events`] will call [`handle_event`] for each pending
/// event since the last invocation.
///
/// In order to ensure no [`Event`]s are lost, implementors of this trait will persist [`Event`]s
/// and replay any unhandled events on startup. An [`Event`] is considered handled when
/// [`process_pending_events`] returns, thus handlers MUST fully handle [`Event`]s and persist any
/// relevant changes to disk *before* returning.
///
/// Further, because an application may crash between an [`Event`] being handled and the
/// implementor of this trait being re-serialized, [`Event`] handling must be idempotent - in
/// effect, [`Event`]s may be replayed.
///
/// Note, handlers may call back into the provider and thus deadlocking must be avoided. Be sure to
/// consult the provider's documentation on the implication of processing events and how a handler
/// may safely use the provider (e.g., see [`ChannelManager::process_pending_events`] and
/// [`ChainMonitor::process_pending_events`]).
