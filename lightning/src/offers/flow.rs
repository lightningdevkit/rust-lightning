/// Facilitates the handling, communication, and management of Offers messages within a Lightning
/// node, enabling the creation, verification, and resolution of BOLT 12 invoices and related
/// payment flows.
///
/// The `OffersMessageFlow` struct integrates several components to manage the lifecycle of Offers
/// messages, ensuring robust communication and payment handling:
/// - [`EntropySource`] to provide cryptographic randomness essential for Offers message handling.
/// - [`Logger`] for detailed operational logging of Offers-related activity.
/// - [`OffersMessageCommons`] for core operations shared across Offers messages, such as metadata
///   verification and signature handling.
/// - MessageRouter for routing Offers messages to their appropriate destinations within the
///   Lightning network.
/// - Manages [`OffersMessage`] for creating and processing Offers-related messages.
/// - Handles [`DNSResolverMessage`] for resolving human-readable names in Offers messages
///   (when the `dnssec` feature is enabled).
///
/// Key Features:
/// - Supports creating BOLT 12 Offers, invoice requests, and refunds.
/// - Integrates with the Lightning node's broader message and payment infrastructure.
/// - Handles cryptographic operations and message validation to ensure compliance with BOLT 12.
/// - Supports DNS resolution for human-readable names (when enabled with `dnssec` feature).
///
/// This struct is essential for enabling BOLT12 payment workflows in the Lightning network,
/// providing the foundational mechanisms for Offers and related message exchanges.
///
/// ## Relationship with `ChannelManager`
///
/// [`OffersMessageFlow`] and [`ChannelManager`] work in tandem to facilitate BOLT 12 functionality within
/// a Lightning node:
/// - The `OffersMessageFlow` is responsible for creating, managing, and verifying Offers messages,
///   such as BOLT 12 invoices and refunds.
/// - The `ChannelManager` manages the lifecycle of payments tied to these Offers messages, handling
///   tasks like payment execution, tracking payment states, and processing related events.
///
/// The relationship is further reinforced through the [`OffersMessageCommons`] trait:
/// - `ChannelManager` implements the [`OffersMessageCommons`] trait, providing shared functionality
///   such as metadata verification and signature handling.
/// - `OffersMessageFlow` relies on this trait to perform common operations, enabling it to delegate
///   these tasks to `ChannelManager` by default.
///
/// Practical Use Case:
/// - A BOLT 12 Offer is created using `OffersMessageFlow`, which provides the necessary interface
///   for Offer creation and invoice generation.
/// - Once a payment is initiated for the Offer, `ChannelManager` takes over, managing the payment's
///   lifecycle, including retries, claims, and event handling.
/// - Events such as `Event::PaymentClaimable` or `Event::PaymentFailed` are processed by
///   `ChannelManager`, which may invoke functionality defined in `OffersMessageCommons` to support
///   Offers-related operations.
///
/// This modular and decoupled design ensures that `OffersMessageFlow` and `ChannelManager` can
/// operate independently while maintaining a seamless integration for handling Offers and payments
/// in the Lightning network.
///
/// ## BOLT 12 Offers
///
/// The [`offers`] module is useful for creating BOLT 12 offers. An [`Offer`] is a precursor to a
/// [`Bolt12Invoice`], which must first be requested by the payer. The interchange of these messages
/// as defined in the specification is handled by [`OffersMessageFlow`] and its implementation of
/// [`OffersMessageHandler`]. However, this only works with an [`Offer`] created using a builder
/// returned by [`create_offer_builder`]. With this approach, BOLT 12 offers and invoices are
/// stateless just as BOLT 11 invoices are.

	/// Pays for an [`Offer`] looked up using [BIP 353] Human Readable Names resolved by the DNS
	/// resolver(s) at `dns_resolvers` which resolve names according to bLIP 32.
	///
	/// If the wallet supports paying on-chain schemes, you should instead use
	/// [`OMNameResolver::resolve_name`] and [`OMNameResolver::handle_dnssec_proof_for_uri`] (by
	/// implementing [`DNSResolverMessageHandler`]) directly to look up a URI and then delegate to
	/// your normal URI handling.
	///
	/// If `max_total_routing_fee_msat` is not specified, the default from
	/// [`RouteParameters::from_payment_params_and_value`] is applied.
	///
	/// # Payment
	///
	/// The provided `payment_id` is used to ensure that only one invoice is paid for the request
	/// when received. See [Avoiding Duplicate Payments] for other requirements once the payment has
	/// been sent.
	///
	/// To revoke the request, use [`ChannelManager::abandon_payment`] prior to receiving the
	/// invoice. If abandoned, or an invoice isn't received in a reasonable amount of time, the
	/// payment will fail with an [`Event::InvoiceRequestFailed`].
	///
	/// # Privacy
	///
	/// For payer privacy, uses a derived payer id and uses [`MessageRouter::create_blinded_paths`]
	/// to construct a [`BlindedPath`] for the reply path. For further privacy implications, see the
	/// docs of the parameterized [`Router`], which implements [`MessageRouter`].
	///
	/// # Limitations
	///
	/// Requires a direct connection to the given [`Destination`] as well as an introduction node in
	/// [`Offer::paths`] or to [`Offer::signing_pubkey`], if empty. A similar restriction applies to
	/// the responding [`Bolt12Invoice::payment_paths`].
	///
	/// # Errors
	///
	/// Errors if:
	/// - a duplicate `payment_id` is provided given the caveats in the aforementioned link,
	///
	/// [`Bolt12Invoice::payment_paths`]: crate::offers::invoice::Bolt12Invoice::payment_paths
	/// [Avoiding Duplicate Payments]: #avoiding-duplicate-payments
