	/// We have some funds available on chain which we need to spend prior to some expiry time at
	/// which point our counterparty may be able to steal them. Generally we have in the high tens
	/// to low hundreds of blocks to get our transaction on-chain, but we shouldn't risk too low a
	/// fee - this should be a relatively high priority feerate.
	OnChainSweep,
	/// This is the lowest feerate we will allow our channel counterparty to have in an anchor
	/// channel in order to close the channel if a channel party goes away.
	///
	/// This needs to be sufficient to get into the mempool when the channel needs to
	/// be force-closed. Setting too high may result in force-closures if our counterparty attempts
	/// to use a lower feerate. Because this is for anchor channels, we can always bump the feerate
	/// later; the feerate here only needs to be sufficient to enter the mempool.
	///
	/// A good estimate is the expected mempool minimum at the time of force-closure. Obviously this
	/// is not an estimate which is very easy to calculate because we do not know the future. Using
	/// a simple long-term fee estimate or tracking of the mempool minimum is a good approach to
	/// ensure you can always close the channel. A future change to Bitcoin's P2P network
	/// (package relay) may obviate the need for this entirely.
	MinAllowedAnchorChannelRemoteFee,

	///
	/// This is the feerate on the transaction which we (or our counterparty) will broadcast in
	/// order to close the channel if a channel party goes away. Setting this value too high will
	/// cause immediate force-closures in order to avoid having an unbroadcastable state.
	///
	/// This feerate represents the fee we pick now, which must be sufficient to enter a block at an
	/// arbitrary time in the future. Obviously this is not an estimate which is very easy to
	/// calculate. This can leave channels subject to being unable to close if feerates rise, and in
	/// general you should prefer anchor channels to ensure you can increase the feerate when the
	/// transactions need broadcasting.
	///
	/// Do note some fee estimators round up to the next full sat/vbyte (ie 250 sats per kw),
	/// causing occasional issues with feerate disagreements between an initiator that wants a
	/// feerate of 1.1 sat/vbyte and a receiver that wants 1.1 rounded up to 2. If your fee
	/// estimator rounds subtracting 250 to your desired feerate here can help avoid this issue.

	MinAllowedNonAnchorChannelRemoteFee,
	/// This is the feerate on the transaction which we (or our counterparty) will broadcast in

	///
	/// This needs to be sufficient to get into the mempool when the channel needs to
	/// be force-closed. Setting too low may result in force-closures. Because this is for anchor
	/// channels, it can be a low value as we can always bump the feerate later.

	AnchorChannelFee,
	/// Lightning is built around the ability to broadcast a transaction in the future to close our
	/// channel and claim all pending funds. In order to do so, non-anchor channels are built with
	/// transactions which we need to be able to broadcast at some point in the future.
	///
	/// This feerate represents the fee we pick now, which must be sufficient to enter a block at an
	/// arbitrary time in the future. Obviously this is not an estimate which is very easy to
	/// calculate, so most lightning nodes use some relatively high-priority feerate using the
	/// current mempool. This leaves channels subject to being unable to close if feerates rise, and
	/// in general you should prefer anchor channels to ensure you can increase the feerate when the
	/// transactions need broadcasting.
	///
	/// Since this should represent the feerate of a channel close that does not need fee
	/// bumping, this is also used as an upper bound for our attempted feerate when doing cooperative
	/// closure of any channel.
	NonAnchorChannelFee,
	/// When cooperatively closing a channel, this is the minimum feerate we will accept.
	/// Recommended at least within a day or so worth of blocks.
	///
	/// This will also be used when initiating a cooperative close of a channel. When closing a
	/// channel you can override this fee by using

	/// [`SpendableOutputDescriptor`]s after a channel closure.
	///
	/// Generally spending these outputs is safe as long as they eventually confirm, so a value
	/// (slightly above) the mempool minimum should suffice. However, as this value will influence
	/// how long funds will be unavailable after channel closure, [`FeeEstimator`] implementors
	/// might want to choose a higher feerate to regain control over funds faster.
