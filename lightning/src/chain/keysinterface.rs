impl KeysManager {
	/// Constructs a KeysManager from a 32-byte seed. If the seed is in some way biased (eg your
	/// RNG is busted) this may panic (but more importantly, you will possibly lose funds).
	/// starting_time isn't strictly required to actually be a time, but it must absolutely,
	/// without a doubt, be unique to this instance. ie if you start multiple times with the same
	/// seed, starting_time must be unique to each run. Thus, the easiest way to achieve this is to
	/// simply use the current time (with very high precision).
	///
	/// The seed MUST be backed up safely prior to use so that the keys can be re-created, however,
	/// obviously, starting_time should be unique every time you reload the library - it is only
	/// used to generate new ephemeral key data (which will be stored by the individual channel if
	/// necessary).
	///
	/// Note that the seed is required to recover certain on-chain funds independent of
	/// ChannelMonitor data, though a current copy of ChannelMonitor data is also required for any
	/// channel, and some on-chain during-closing funds.
	///
	/// Note that until the 0.1 release there is no guarantee of backward compatibility between
	/// versions. Once the library is more fully supported, the docs will be updated to include a
	/// detailed description of the guarantee.
