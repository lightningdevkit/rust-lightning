	/// Limit our total exposure to potential loss to on-chain fees on close, including in-flight

	///
	/// # HTLC-based Dust Exposure
	///
	/// When an HTLC present in one of our channels is below a "dust" threshold, the HTLC will
	/// not be claimable on-chain, instead being turned into additional miner fees if either
	/// party force-closes the channel. Because the threshold is per-HTLC, our total exposure
	/// to such payments may be substantial if there are many dust HTLCs present when the
	/// channel is force-closed.
	///
	/// The dust threshold for each HTLC is based on the `dust_limit_satoshis` for each party in a
	/// channel negotiated throughout the channel open process, along with the fees required to have
	/// a broadcastable HTLC spending transaction. When a channel supports anchor outputs
	/// (specifically the zero fee HTLC transaction variant), this threshold no longer takes into
	/// account the HTLC transaction fee as it is zero. Because of this, you may want to set this
	/// value to a fixed limit for channels using anchor outputs, while the fee rate multiplier
	/// variant is primarily intended for use with pre-anchor channels.
	///
	/// The selected limit is applied for sent, forwarded, and received HTLCs and limits the total
	/// exposure across all three types per-channel.
	///
	/// # Transaction Fee Dust Exposure
	///
	/// Further, counterparties broadcasting a commitment transaction in a force-close may result
	/// in other balance being burned to fees, and thus all fees on commitment and HTLC
	/// transactions in excess of our local fee estimates are included in the dust calculation.
	///
	/// Because of this, another way to look at this limit is to divide it by 43,000 (or 218,750
	/// for non-anchor channels) and see it as the maximum feerate disagreement (in sats/vB) per
	/// non-dust HTLC we're allowed to have with our peers before risking a force-closure for
	/// inbound channels.
	// This works because, for anchor channels the on-chain cost is 172 weight (172+703 for
	// non-anchors with an HTLC-Success transaction), i.e.
	// dust_exposure_limit_msat / 1000 = 172 * feerate_in_sat_per_vb / 4 * HTLC count
	// dust_exposure_limit_msat = 43,000 * feerate_in_sat_per_vb * HTLC count
	// dust_exposure_limit_msat / HTLC count / 43,000 = feerate_in_sat_per_vb
	///
	/// Thus, for the default value of 10_000 * a current feerate estimate of 10 sat/vB (or 2,500
	/// sat/KW), we risk force-closure if we disagree with our peer by:
	/// * `10_000 * 2_500 / 43_000 / (483*2)` = 0.6 sat/vB for anchor channels with 483 HTLCs in
	///   both directions (the maximum),
	/// * `10_000 * 2_500 / 43_000 / (50*2)` = 5.8 sat/vB for anchor channels with 50 HTLCs in both
	///   directions (the LDK default max from [`ChannelHandshakeConfig::our_max_accepted_htlcs`])
	/// * `10_000 * 2_500 / 218_750 / (483*2)` = 0.1 sat/vB for non-anchor channels with 483 HTLCs
	///   in both directions (the maximum),
	/// * `10_000 * 2_500 / 218_750 / (50*2)` = 1.1 sat/vB for non-anchor channels with 50 HTLCs
	///   in both (the LDK default maximum from [`ChannelHandshakeConfig::our_max_accepted_htlcs`])
	///
	/// Note that when using [`MaxDustHTLCExposure::FeeRateMultiplier`] this maximum disagreement
	/// will scale linearly with increases (or decreases) in the our feerate estimates. Further,
	/// for anchor channels we expect our counterparty to use a relatively low feerate estimate
