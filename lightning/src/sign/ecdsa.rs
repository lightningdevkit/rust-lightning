/// A trait to sign Lightning channel transactions as described in
/// [BOLT 3](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md).
///
/// Signing services could be implemented on a hardware wallet and should implement signing
/// policies in order to be secure. Please refer to the [VLS Policy
/// Controls](https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/docs/policy-controls.md)
/// for an example of such policies.
///
/// Like [`ChannelSigner`], many of the methods allow errors to be returned to support async
/// signing. In such cases, the signing operation can be replayed by calling
/// [`ChannelManager::signer_unblocked`] or [`ChainMonitor::signer_unblocked`] (see individual
/// method documentation for which method should be called) once the result is ready, at which
/// point the channel operation will resume.
