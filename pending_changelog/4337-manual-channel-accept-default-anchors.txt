# API Updates

 * `ChannelHandshakeConfig::negotiate_anchors_zero_fee_htlc_tx`
   now defaults to `true` (previously `false`). This means anchor output channels
   will be negotiated by default for all new channels if the counterparty supports
   it, requiring users to maintain an on-chain reserve for fee bumping in the
   event of force-closes.

 * All inbound channels now require manual acceptance.
   `UserConfig::manually_accept_inbound_channels` has been removed, and
   `Event::OpenChannelRequest` will now always be generated for inbound channel
   requests. Users must handle this event and call either
   `ChannelManager::accept_inbound_channel` (or
   `accept_inbound_channel_from_trusted_peer_0conf` for zero-conf channels) to
   accept the channel, or `ChannelManager::force_close_broadcasting_latest_txn`
   to reject it. This ensures users can verify they have sufficient on-chain
   funds before accepting channels with anchor outputs.
