# API Updates

 * `Event::SpliceFailed` no longer carries `contributed_inputs` or `contributed_outputs` fields.
   Instead, a separate `Event::DiscardFunding` event with `FundingInfo::Contribution` is emitted
   for UTXO cleanup.

 * `Event::DiscardFunding` with `FundingInfo::Contribution` is also emitted without a
   corresponding `Event::SpliceFailed` when `ChannelManager::funding_contributed` returns an
   error (e.g., channel or peer not found, wrong channel state, duplicate contribution).

# Backwards Compatibility

 * Older serializations that included `contributed_inputs` and `contributed_outputs` in
   `SpliceFailed` will have those fields silently ignored on deserialization (they were odd TLV
   fields). A `DiscardFunding` event will not be produced when reading these older serializations.

# Forward Compatibility

 * Downgrading will not set the removed `contributed_inputs`/`contributed_outputs` fields on
   `SpliceFailed`, so older code expecting those fields will see empty vectors for splice
   failures.
