## API Updates
- `Event::PaymentPathFailed::network_update` has been replaced by a new `Failure` enum, which may
	contain the `network_update` within it. See `Event::PaymentPathFailed::failure` and `Failure` docs
	for more
- `Event::PaymentPathFailed::all_paths_failed` has been removed, as we've dropped support for manual
	payment retries.

## Backwards Compatibility
- If downgrading from 0.0.114 to a previous version, `Event::PaymentPathFailed::network_update` will
	always be `None`.
- If downgrading from 0.0.114 to a previous version, `Event::PaymentPathFailed::all_paths_failed`
	will always be set to `false`. Users who wish to support downgrading and currently rely on the
	field should should first migrate to always calling `ChannelManager::abandon_payment` and awaiting
	`PaymentFailed` events before retrying (see the field docs for more info on this approach:
	<https://docs.rs/lightning/0.0.113/lightning/util/events/enum.Event.html#variant.PaymentPathFailed.field.all_paths_failed>),
	and then migrate to 0.0.114.
