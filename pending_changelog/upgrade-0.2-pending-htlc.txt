Backwards Compatibility
=======================

 * Upgrading directly from 0.2 to 0.5 with pending HTLC forwards is not supported.
   If you have pending HTLC forwards when upgrading from 0.2, you must first upgrade
   to 0.3, forward the HTLCs (completing at least the outbound commitment), then
   upgrade to 0.5. Attempting to upgrade directly from 0.2 to 0.5 with pending HTLC
   forwards will result in a `DecodeError::InvalidValue` when reading the
   `ChannelManager`.
