# API Updates (0.2)
 * Accepting dual-funded (V2 establishment) channels (without contibuting) is now supported (#3137).
   Some particulars to be aware of for this feature:
   * Creating dual-funded channels is not yet supported.
   * Contributing funds (inputs) to accepted channels is not yet supported.
   * `Event::OpenChannelRequest::push_msat` has been replaced by the field `channel_negotiation_type` to
     differentiate between an inbound request for a dual-funded (V2) or non-dual-funded (V1) channel to be
     opened, with value being either of the enum variants `InboundChannelFunds::DualFunded` and
     `InboundChannelFunds::PushMsat { push_msat, channel_reserve_satoshis }` corresponding to V2 and V1 channel open requests respectively.
   * Similar to V1 channels, `ChannelManager::accept_inbound_channel()` can also be used
     to accept an inbound V2 channel.
   * 0conf dual-funded channels are not supported.
   * RBF of dual-funded channel funding transactions is not supported.
