Rust-Lightning, not Rusty's Lightning!
=====

Documentation can be found at [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/lightning/)

Currently somewhere near 40% towards usable, published to see if there is any
real interest from folks in using a lightning rust library.

The goal is to provide a full-featured but also incredibly flexible lightning
implementation, allowing the user to decide how they wish to use it. With that
in mind, everything should be exposed via simple, composable APIs. The user
should be able to decide whether they wish to use their own threading/execution
models, allowing usage inside of existing library architectures, or allow us to
handle that for them. Same goes with network connections - if the user wishes
to use their own networking stack, they should be able to do so! This all means
that we should provide simple external interfaces which allow the user to drive
all execution, while implementing sample execution drivers that create a
full-featured lightning daemon by default.

For security reasons, do not add new dependencies. Really do not add new
non-optional/non-test/non-library dependencies. Really really do not add
dependencies with dependencies. Do convince Andrew to cut down dependency usage
in rust-bitcoin.

Notes on coding style:
 * Use tabs. If you want to align lines, use spaces. Any desired alignment
   should display fine at any tab-length display setting.
