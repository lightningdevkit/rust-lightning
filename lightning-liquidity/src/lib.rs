#![crate_name = "lightning_liquidity"]

//! The goal of this crate is to provide types and primitives to integrate a spec-compliant LSP
//! with an LDK-based node. To this end, this crate provides client-side as well as service-side
//! logic to implement the LSPS specifications.
//!
//! **Note**: Service-side support is currently considered "beta", i.e., not fully ready for
//! production use.
//!
//! Currently the following specifications are supported:
//! - [bLIP-50 / LSPS0] defines the transport protocol with the LSP over which the other protocols communicate.
//! - [bLIP-51 / LSPS1] defines a protocol for ordering Lightning channels from an LSP. This is useful when the client needs
//! inbound Lightning liquidity for which they are willing and able to pay in bitcoin.
//! - [bLIP-52 / LSPS2] defines a protocol for generating a special invoice for which, when paid,
//! an LSP will open a "just-in-time" channel. This is useful for the initial on-boarding of
//! clients as the channel opening fees are deducted from the incoming payment, i.e., no funds are
//! required client-side to initiate this flow.
//! - [bLIP-55 / LSPS5] defines a protocol for sending webhook notifications to clients. This is
//! useful for notifying clients about incoming payments, channel expiries, etc.
//!
//! To get started, you'll want to setup a [`LiquidityManager`] and configure it to be the
//! [`CustomMessageHandler`] of your LDK node. You can then for example call
//! [`LiquidityManager::lsps1_client_handler`] / [`LiquidityManager::lsps2_client_handler`], or
//! [`LiquidityManager::lsps2_service_handler`], to access the respective client-side or
//! service-side handlers.
//!
//! [`LiquidityManager`] uses an eventing system to notify the user about important updates to the
//! protocol flow. To this end, you will need to handle events emitted via one of the event
//! handling methods provided by [`LiquidityManager`], e.g., [`LiquidityManager::next_event`].
