//! The logic to monitor for on-chain transactions and create the relevant claim responses lives
//! here.
//!
//! ChannelMonitor objects are generated by ChannelManager in response to relevant
//! messages/actions, and MUST be persisted to disk (and, preferably, remotely) before progress can
//! be made in responding to certain messages, see [`chain::Watch`] for more.
//!
//! Note that ChannelMonitors are an important part of the lightning trust model and a copy of the
//! latest ChannelMonitor must always be actively monitoring for chain updates (and no out-of-date
//! ChannelMonitors should do so). Thus, if you're building rust-lightning into an HSM or other
//! security-domain-separated system design, you should consider having multiple paths for
//! ChannelMonitors to get out of the HSM and onto monitoring devices.

	///
	/// Such a failure will \"freeze\" a channel, preventing us from revoking old states or
	/// submitting new commitment transactions to the counterparty. Once the update(s) which failed
	/// have been successfully applied, ChannelManager::channel_monitor_updated can be used to
	/// restore the channel to an operational state.
	///
	/// Note that a given ChannelManager will *never* re-generate a given ChannelMonitorUpdate. If
	/// you return a TemporaryFailure you must ensure that it is written to disk safely before
	/// writing out the latest ChannelManager state.
	///
	/// Even when a channel has been \"frozen\" updates to the ChannelMonitor can continue to occur
	/// (eg if an inbound HTLC which we forwarded was claimed upstream resulting in us attempting
	/// to claim it on this channel) and those updates must be applied wherever they can be. At
	/// least one such updated ChannelMonitor must be persisted otherwise PermanentFailure should
	/// be returned to get things on-chain ASAP using only the in-memory copy. Obviously updates to
	/// the channel which would invalidate previous ChannelMonitors are not made when a channel has
	/// been \"frozen\".
	///
	/// Note that even if updates made after TemporaryFailure succeed you must still call
	/// channel_monitor_updated to ensure you have the latest monitor and re-enable normal channel
	/// operation.
	///
	/// Note that the update being processed here will not be replayed for you when you call
	/// ChannelManager::channel_monitor_updated, so you must store the update itself along
	/// with the persisted ChannelMonitor on your own local disk prior to returning a
	/// TemporaryFailure. You may, of course, employ a journaling approach, storing only the
	/// ChannelMonitorUpdate on disk without updating the monitor itself, replaying the journal at
	/// reload-time.
	///
	/// For deployments where a copy of ChannelMonitors and other local state are backed up in a
	/// remote location (with local copies persisted immediately), it is anticipated that all
	/// updates will return TemporaryFailure until the remote copies could be updated.
	TemporaryFailure,
	/// Used to indicate no further channel monitor updates will be allowed (eg we've moved on to a
	/// different watchtower and cannot update with all watchtowers that were previously informed
	/// of this channel).
	///
	/// At reception of this error, ChannelManager will force-close the channel and return at
	/// least a final ChannelMonitorUpdate::ChannelForceClosed which must be delivered to at
	/// least one ChannelMonitor copy. Revocation secret MUST NOT be released and offchain channel
	/// update must be rejected.
	///
	/// This failure may also signal a failure to update the local persisted copy of one of
	/// the channel monitor instance.
	///
	/// Note that even when you fail a holder commitment transaction update, you must store the
	/// update to ensure you can claim from it in case of a duplicate copy of this ChannelMonitor
	/// broadcasts it (e.g distributed channel-monitor deployment)
	///
	/// In case of distributed watchtowers deployment, the new version must be written to disk, as
	/// state may have been stored but rejected due to a block forcing a commitment broadcast. This
	/// storage is used to claim outputs of rejected state confirmed onchain by another watchtower,
	/// lagging behind on block processing.
