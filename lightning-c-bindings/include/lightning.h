    *
    * Even when a channel has been \"frozen\" updates to the ChannelMonitor can continue to occur

    * with the persisted ChannelMonitor on your own local disk prior to returning a
    * TemporaryFailure. You may, of course, employ a journaling approach, storing only the
    * ChannelMonitorUpdate on disk without updating the monitor itself, replaying the journal at
    * reload-time.
    *
    * For deployments where a copy of ChannelMonitors and other local state are backed up in a

 *
 * Note that you can be a bit lazier about writing out ChannelManager than you can be with

 * returning from chain::Watch::watch_/update_channel, with ChannelManagers, writing updates
 * happens out-of-band (and will prevent any other ChannelManager operations from occurring during
 * the serialization process). If the deserialized version is out-of-date compared to the

 * ChannelMonitor state and no funds will be lost (mod on-chain transaction fees).
 *
 * Note that the deserializer is only implemented for (BlockHash, ChannelManager), which
 * tells you the last block hash which was block_connect()ed. You MUST rescan any blocks along

 * block_connected() to step towards your best block) upon deserialization before using the
 * object!
 *
 * Note that ChannelManager is responsible for tracking liveness of its channels and generating
 * ChannelUpdate messages informing peers that the channel is temporarily disabled. To avoid
 * spam due to quick disconnection/reconnection, updates are not sent until the channel has been
 * offline for a full minute. In order to track this, you must call
 * timer_chan_freshness_every_min roughly once per minute, though it doesn't have to be perfect.
 *

    *
    * Note that on every update, you **must** persist either the
    * `ChannelMonitorUpdate` or the updated monitor itself to disk/backups. See
    * the `Persist` trait documentation for more details.
    *
    * If an implementer chooses to persist the updates only, they need to make
    * sure that all the updates are applied to the `ChannelMonitors` *before*
    * the set of channel monitors is given to the `ChannelManager`
    * deserialization routine. See [`ChannelMonitor::update_monitor`] for
    * applying a monitor update to a monitor. If full `ChannelMonitors` are
    * persisted, then there is no need to persist individual updates.
    *
    * Note that there could be a performance tradeoff between persisting complete
    * channel monitors on every update vs. persisting only updates and applying
    * them in batches. The size of each monitor grows `O(number of state updates)`
    * whereas updates are small and `O(1)`.

    * See [`ChannelMonitor::serialize_for_disk`] for writing out a `ChannelMonitor`,

/**
 * Arguments for the creation of a ChannelManager that are not deserialized.
 *
 * At a high-level, the process for deserializing a ChannelManager and resuming normal operation
 * is:
 * 1) Deserialize all stored ChannelMonitors.
 * 2) Deserialize the ChannelManager by filling in this struct and calling:
 *    <(BlockHash, ChannelManager)>::read(reader, args)
 *    This may result in closing some Channels if the ChannelMonitor is newer than the stored
 *    ChannelManager state to ensure no loss of funds. Thus, transactions may be broadcasted.
 * 3) If you are not fetching full blocks, register all relevant ChannelMonitor outpoints the same
 *    way you would handle a `chain::Filter` call using ChannelMonitor::get_outputs_to_watch() and
 *    ChannelMonitor::get_funding_txo().
 * 4) Reconnect blocks on your ChannelMonitors.
 * 5) Disconnect/connect blocks on the ChannelManager.
 * 6) Move the ChannelMonitors into your local chain::Watch.
 *
 * Note that the ordering of #4-6 is not of importance, however all three must occur before you
 * call any other methods on the newly-deserialized ChannelManager.
 *
 * Note that because some channels may be closed during deserialization, it is critical that you
 * always deserialize only the latest version of a ChannelManager and ChannelMonitors available to
 * you. If you deserialize an old ChannelManager (during which force-closure transactions may be
 * broadcast), and then later deserialize a newer version of the same ChannelManager (which will
 * not force-close the same channels but consider them live), you may end up revoking a state for
 * which you've already broadcasted the transaction.
