# Our tests do actual crypto and lots of work, the tradeoff for -O1 is well worth it.
# Ideally we would only do this in profile.test, but profile.test only applies to
# the test binary, not dependencies, which means most of the critical code still
# gets compiled as -O0. See
# https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#profile-selection
